Java Mastery
This is quick... 


                  YOU NEED TO MASTER JAVA.

Although every language is different, and you might think, "screw this I'll learn another," NO. NOOO.. Remember, not all languages cam be learnt "fully or deeply".

                  YOU NEED TO PICK A POISON. 

True, Java gets a bad reputation, but it is a great poison to have. It will allow you to turn your hand to others languages super fast! You can drop down into C++ and C,
or pop up into Scripting languages like Python, JavaScript, etc, which are extremely popular... Java is the jack of all trades -- the ultimate all-rounder -- at the expense of
being master of none... But remember all-rounders win decathlons! And if an all-rounder chooses to specialise, then oh-snap watch out!




WHAT THIS MEANS:

Magic happens within the quirks of Java. Forget other languages (for now) because we're gonna contort this beast at our will.
Efficiency is always in the details: just as money is made between the lines.

We will get fussy with syntax. It looks messy, but Java's actually being upfront about 90% of what it's doing...
Unlike other languages that sweep this information under the rug. Higher level languages work well for a while, but they're heavy, and when they break it's incredibly complex, leaving 
you to look like a chump.
