Java

It's old but not obsolete. 

Recently I heard Java was about the only language you can learn fully. This is true.
Sure lower-level C++ and C can also be learnt fully - but doing so takes longer and won't deliver the same bredth of understanding.

Java somehow scratches into fast moving industries (like web and mobile app development), offerring robustness to large enterprises.
Java is robust because it is "statically typed". In other words, while coding you must specify a variable's "type" as you create it (e.g. an integer or a char variable).
Static languages are compiled by a "compiler" before being run. Together these factors make Java programming complicated and slow.

"Dynamically typed" languages (also known as scripting or interpreted languages) don't force coders to specify a variable's type. There is no compiler step either. Thus, development 
becomes simpler and code is ready to run as you type it. The catch is that such programs are prone to bugs; in good conscience dynamic languages shouldn't be used in safety-critical contexts.

Anyhow, comparisons aside... The great thing about learning Java is you also learn everything that surrounds it!

That is, you appreciate the low-level grit of C/C++, and also the high-level fury of scripting (JavaScript, Python, Ruby, PHP, etc). 
Some experts may disagree with my conclusion. Ironic. If you don't have the resolve to tackle Java, you're probably not a computer sciencist, or an embedded / software engineer.

There are no shortcuts.
