Java The Creator


You have had the crash course thus far.

Agenda:
- More typical libraries, miscellaneous concepts, and techniques
- Laying out a Java Program for different Applications

I'm going to give you a chuncky end to this course!
If you can finish this all at once, you'll walk away as a master: 
          - The tools for creation (from idea to specific code) will be at your fingertips. 
          - And the concepts you have seen will only repeat themselves in different ways for different languages.




More typical libraries, miscellaneous concepts, and techniques:
Library Structure, IDEs and best library tools, Streams, I/O techniques, OOP Java Quirks, Powerful loops/ways of doing stuff, How to set it up for regression (make this practical and chronological for how someone might try them)
The things I'm missing (networking + more) -> can check out these resources... javadocs for 23 and oracles user guides. LINKS

Laying out a Java Program for different Applications:
Simulations (types), Games (brief intro to Kotlin, java upsides and downsides here), Planners and connections (transport networks, social connections) and Widget-tools (drawing & undo, organisation hierarchies)
