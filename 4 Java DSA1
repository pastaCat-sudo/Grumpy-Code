Java DSA

That's "Data Structures and Algorithms" 


DSAs are absolutely massive in programming, and computing in general. Sounds ambiguous though right? Like, what's a data structure? 
And what constitutes a conventional algorithm?

Yeah it's something you need to be in "the-know" about because there actually are very clear standards.
Such standards are often poorly taught, because they're hard to make practical!!!
- That is, things are often missed when a teacher tries to show how a concept can be translated into code!

But you have me, Grumpy...
