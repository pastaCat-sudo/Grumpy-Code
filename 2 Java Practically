Java Practically

There is a hierarchy when downloading the "Java stuff you need." 


SIMPLY GET THE LASTEST JDK... DONE.

My outlook:

JDK (Java Development Kit): 
Effectively all you need to get started. It's like the root file of everything Java - everything's inside.
Useful tools I'll mention at this level of the file system are: 
1) Java Compiler (javac), -----------------------------
2) Java Archive Tool (jar), and also the jlink tool (version 9+)
3) Document Generator Tool (javadoc)
4) Java Debugger (jdb)
5) Java Class Dissembler (javap) ----------------------
*) Then there's also "Runtime" stuff - like the fact that common .java files concern the Application Launcher.
*) Finally the familiar "Java Standard Library" (technically an API) is stored here too, in the lib folder.

      JRE (Java Runtime Environment):
      A folder within the JDK. It's important because it holds the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) seen below.
      Also, it holds whatever "libaries are needed for runtime". Apparently before Java 9 these runtime libraries were literal
      duplicates of files from inside the JDK's lib folder (a level up from here), but then, from version 9 onward this stopped.
      Now the "library stuff" needed at runtime is sourced directly from that lib folder (in sophisticated ways). There is no
      need store duplicates anymore.

            JVM (Java Virtual Machine):
            A buzz term... The idea is the JVM lets Java code run on any hardware! Yay. It executes the Java bytecode directly. In a 
            sense your computer doesn't touch the code. From my experience, good features to understand about the JVM straight off the bat are:
            1) It uses a Just-In-Time (JIT) complier
            2) It performs garbage collection (part of memory management)
            (Again, all JVM's roles make it sophisticated. You don't (and I don't) need to know much more - if stuff breaks, then we do a 
            deep-dive to try fix it!)



_____Stupid stuff:_____

Okay, "Java Standard Edition" - pointless term.

So, this is how the Java community "thinks" it works... The Java Standard Edition is the umbrella term that holds the JDK, JRE, and its JVM... Like what?

LOOK, I'LL WILL FINISH THE WAY I STARTED - JUST GET THE JDK, IT'S THAT SIMPLE.
